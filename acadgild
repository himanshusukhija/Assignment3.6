Yes we can overload a method with same return type
suppose consider two examples

1.   int Sum(int a,int b)
2.   int Sum(int a,int b,int c)

Overloading will work with both of the above defined functions
both of them will have same return type ie Integer
if we call Sum(2,3) then the 1st function will be called.
but if we call Sum(2,3,4)  then the 2nd function will be called.
